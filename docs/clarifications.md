These are my efforts to clarify the rules. They are not the official rules or official responses. 


## 1. Investment performance

### Question 1(a)

Is the investment portfolio by which intended to be:

 * One large portfolio comprising stocks and ETFS
 * Five portfolios of at most 5 stocks, and another five portfolios of at most 5 ETFs each? 

### Working assumption

It's just one big portfolio with both stocks and ETFs.  

### Resolution:


### Question 1(b)

How are information ratios combined across the overlapping time-periods, and possible portfolios? 

### Working assumption

Denominator and numerator are totalled first, leading to a single information ratio. 



## 2. Benchark portfolio

### Question:
Why is the benchmark chosen to be the zero portfolio (rather than say, equal positive weights)? The information ratio is undefined at this point. 

### Resolution: 


## 3. Corporate events

## Question(s)

 3a. If a company defaults, will the RET for the day be -1 and 0 thereafter? 
 3b. If a company defaults, will the rank be 1 (or 1.5 if two companies default)? 
 3c. If a company de-lists, will the rank be 1 (or 1.5 if two de-list, etc)? 
 3d. If a company is taken private, will the last recorded stock price persist into the future? 
 3e. If a company is aquired, will the last recorded stock price persist into the future? 
 
## Working assumption:

As inferred from the questions. 

## 4. Dividends

### Question

Do the prices used include dividends?

### Working assumption

Yes, and pretty clearly indicated by the wording "total return". Same for stock splits.
