These are my efforts to clarify the rules. They are not the official rules.

## Investment performance
Is the investment intended to be:

 * One large portfolio comprising stocks and ETFS
 * Five portfolios of at most 5 stocks, and another five portfolios of at most 5 ETFs each? 

I'm assuming the former. 

## Benchark portfolio

The information ratio is undefined if benchmark is the portfolio with no assets. Just an observation.  

## Default

If a company defaults, will the RET for the day be -1 and 0 thereafter? 

If a company defaults, will the rank be 1 (or 1.5 if two companies default)? 

## Aquisitions

If a company is acquired ...

## Dividends

Do the computed returns include dividends? 

(That's how I read it).
